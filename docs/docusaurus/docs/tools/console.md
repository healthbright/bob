# Pilot Console

Local web dashboard at `localhost:41777` — monitor and manage your sessions.

The Console runs locally as a Bun/Express server with a React web UI. It's automatically started when you launch Pilot and stopped when all sessions close. All data — memories, sessions, usage — is stored in a local SQLite database. Nothing leaves your machine.

```bash
$ open http://localhost:41777
```

## Smart Notifications via SSE

The Console sends real-time alerts via Server-Sent Events when Claude needs your input or a significant phase completes. You don't need to watch the terminal constantly — the Console notifies you.

- Plan requires your approval — review and respond in the terminal or via notification
- Spec phase completed — implementation done, verification starting
- Clarification needed — Claude is waiting for design decisions before proceeding
- Session ended — completion summary with observation count

:::info Settings tab
Configure model selection per component — Planning (Opus), Implementation (Sonnet), Verification (Sonnet), each sub-agent independently. Enable the **Extended Context (1M)** toggle to use the 1M token context window across all models simultaneously. *Requires Max 20x or Enterprise subscription.*
