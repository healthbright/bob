# /create-skill — Skill Creator

**Create a reusable skill.** Provide a topic or workflow description, and this command explores the codebase, gathers relevant patterns, and builds a well-structured skill interactively with you. If no topic is given, it evaluates the current session for extractable knowledge.

---

## Phase 0: Reference

### Quality Criteria

- **Reusable**: Will help future tasks, not just this instance
- **Non-trivial**: Required discovery or is a valuable workflow pattern
- **Verified**: Solution actually worked

**Do NOT extract:** Single-step tasks, one-off fixes, knowledge in official docs.

### Project Slug

Prefix ALL created skills with the project slug to avoid name collisions across repos.

```bash
SLUG=$(basename "$(git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null | sed 's/\.git$//')" 2>/dev/null || basename "$PWD")
# Result: "pilot-shell", "my-api", "acme-backend"
```

**Skill scope:** Choose project or global based on reusability.

| Scope | When | Create with | After creating |
|-------|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Project** (`.skillshare/skills/` exists) | Skill is specific to this repo | `skillshare new {slug}-{name} -p` | `skillshare sync -p` |
| **Global** (`skillshare` installed) | Skill applies across projects | `skillshare new {slug}-{name} -g` | `skillshare sync -g` |
| **Fallback** (no skillshare) | Direct creation | Write to `.claude/skills/{slug}-{name}/SKILL.md` | Nothing needed |

**Priority:** Project (`-p`) if `.skillshare/skills/` exists → Global (`-g`) if `skillshare` is installed → Fallback.

**Naming rules:** Lowercase with hyphens only. The slug provides context; the name should be 1-3 words max that are descriptive (not generic). Examples: `pilot-shell-lsp-cleaner`, `my-api-auth-flow`, `acme-deploy`. Never use generic names like "helper", "utils", "tools", "handler", "workflow".

**Organizing into folders (requires skillshare):** Use `--into` to group skills into subdirectories. Skillshare auto-flattens folder paths with `__` separators at the target (e.g., `frontend/react/my-skill/` → `frontend__react__my-skill` in `.claude/skills/`). Recommended structure for global skills:

```
~/.config/skillshare/skills/
├── frontend/              # Personal organized skills
│   └── react/
├── utils/                 # Personal utilities
│   └── code-review/
├── _team-skills/          # Tracked repo (auto-updated)
│   ├── deploy/
│   └── security/
└── _org-standards/        # Another tracked repo
    └── compliance/
```

### Use Case Categories

Identify which category your skill falls into — this guides the structure:

| Category | Used For | Key Techniques |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Document & Asset Creation** | Consistent output (reports, designs, code) | Embedded style guides, templates, quality checklists |
| **Workflow Automation** | Multi-step processes with consistent methodology | Step-by-step gates, validation, iterative refinement |
| **MCP Enhancement** | Workflow guidance on top of MCP tool access | Multi-MCP coordination, domain expertise, error handling |

### Skill Complexity Spectrum

**Move left whenever possible** — simpler skills are more reliable, cheaper to execute, and work across more models.

| Level | Style | Determinism | Best For |
|-------|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Passive** | Context only | N/A | Background knowledge, coding standards |
| **Instructional** | Rules + guidelines | Medium | Code review, style guides |
| **CLI Wrapper** | Calls a binary/script | **High** | Automation, integrations, data processing |
| **Workflow** | Multi-step with validation | Medium | Deploy pipelines, migrations |
| **Generative** | Asks agent to write code | Low | Scaffolding, code generation |

**Key insight:** A skill that says "run `eslint --fix`" works on any model. A skill that says "analyze the code and suggest improvements" requires expensive reasoning. Prefer commands over descriptions, scripts over instructions, explicit values over judgment.

**Problem-first vs tool-first:** Does the user describe an outcome ("set up a project workspace") or a tool ("I have Notion MCP connected")? Problem-first skills orchestrate tools for outcomes. Tool-first skills teach best practices for tools users already have.

### Skill Template

Before writing, answer these five questions:

1. **When should this skill activate?** (→ becomes `description`)
2. **What inputs does it need?** (arguments, files, environment state)
3. **What does success look like?** (specific output, files created, commands run)
4. **What should it NOT do?** (explicit exclusions prevent scope creep)
5. **How do you verify it worked?** (include a validation step)

### File Structure

```
your-skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Required — main skill file (case-sensitive, exactly SKILL.md)
├── scripts/              # Optional — executable code (Python, Bash, etc.)
├── references/           # Optional — detailed docs loaded as needed
└── assets/               # Optional — templates, fonts, icons used in output
```

**Critical rules:**
- File MUST be exactly `SKILL.md` (not SKILL.MD, skill.md, or Skill.md)
- No `README.md` inside the skill folder — all docs go in SKILL.md or `references/`
- Keep SKILL.md under 5,000 words — move detailed docs to `references/` and link

# Skill Name

## Instructions

### Step 1: [First Major Step]
Clear explanation of what happens.

### Step 2: [Next Step]
[Continue with concrete, verifiable steps]

## Common Issues

### [Error message or symptom]
**Cause:** [Why it happens]
**Solution:** [How to fix — specific command or action]

## Examples

### Example 1: [Common scenario]
User says: "[typical request]"
Actions: [what the skill does]
Result: [expected outcome]

## When NOT to Use
[Explicit exclusions — prevents scope creep and misactivation]
```

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `name` | Yes | Kebab-case only, no spaces or capitals, must match folder name |
| `description` | Yes | Under 1024 chars, no XML tags (`<` or `>`). Include WHAT + WHEN + trigger phrases |
| `targets` | No | Restrict sync to specific CLIs (e.g., `[claude]`). Omit to sync everywhere |
| `tags` | No | Categories for hub search and filtering (e.g., `[debugging, python]`) |
| `license` | No | License identifier (e.g., `MIT`, `Apache-2.0`) |
| `allowed-tools` | No | Restrict which tools the skill can access (e.g., `Bash(python:*) WebFetch`) |
| `compatibility` | No | Environment requirements (1-500 chars) |
| `metadata` | No | Custom key-value pairs: `author`, `version`, `mcp-server`, `category`, etc. |

**Security restrictions:** No XML angle brackets (`<` `>`) in frontmatter — frontmatter appears in the system prompt. Skills with "claude" or "anthropic" in the name are reserved.

### The Description Field

**Formula:** `[What it does] + [When to use it] + [Key capabilities]`

**Good descriptions:**

```yaml
# Specific and actionable — includes trigger phrases
description: Analyzes Figma design files and generates developer handoff
  documentation. Use when user uploads .fig files, asks for "design specs",
  "component documentation", or "design-to-code handoff".

# Clear value proposition with scope
description: End-to-end customer onboarding workflow for PayFlow. Handles
  account creation, payment setup, and subscription management. Use when
  user says "onboard new customer", "set up subscription", or "create
  PayFlow account".
```

**Bad descriptions:**

```yaml
# Too vague — won't trigger
description: Helps with projects.

# Missing triggers — Claude can't match user requests
description: Creates sophisticated multi-page documentation systems.

# Too technical, no user triggers
description: Implements the Project entity model with hierarchical relationships.
```

**⚠️ The Description Trap:** If description summarizes the workflow, Claude follows the short description as a shortcut instead of reading SKILL.md. Always describe trigger conditions, not process.

### Progressive Disclosure

Three-level system — each level loads only when needed:

| Level | What | When Loaded | Context Cost |
|-------|------|-------------|--------------|
| **1. Frontmatter** | `description` in YAML | Always (system prompt) | ~100 tokens |
| **2. SKILL.md body** | Full instructions | When Claude thinks skill is relevant | ~1000+ tokens |
| **3. Linked files** | `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` | When Claude navigates to them | Only on demand |

**Rule of thumb:** "Is this line worth the context tokens it costs?" Don't explain what AI already knows. Only add your project's specific conventions, internal APIs, and domain rules.

**Size limits:** SKILL.md under 5,000 words / 500 lines. Move detailed docs to `references/` and link:

```markdown
Before writing queries, consult `references/api-patterns.md` for:
- Rate limiting guidance
- Pagination patterns
- Error codes and handling
```

### Instructions Best Practices

**Be specific and actionable:**

```markdown
# Good
Run `python scripts/validate.py --input {filename}` to check data format.
If validation fails, common issues include:
- Missing required fields (add them to the CSV)
- Invalid date formats (use YYYY-MM-DD)

# Bad
Validate the data before proceeding.
```

**Include error handling** — anticipate what goes wrong and provide fixes in the skill.

**Put critical instructions at the top** — use `## Important` or `## Critical` headers. Repeat key points if needed — instructions buried at the bottom get ignored.

---

## Phase 1: Understand the Topic

**Start here — clarify what skill to build.**

If the user provided a topic or description, work with it. If not, evaluate the current session (see Session Mode below).

### Topic-Driven Mode (Primary)

1. Restate the topic in your own words — what workflow, pattern, or problem does this skill address?
2. Ask clarifying questions if needed:
   - What triggers this workflow? (specific error, specific task type, specific file pattern)
   - What does success look like? (a command runs successfully, a file is created, a pattern is consistently applied)
   - Is this specific to this project or reusable across projects?
3. **Explore the codebase for relevant patterns:**
   ```bash
   # Find existing patterns related to the topic
   probe search "<topic keywords>" ./ --max-results 5 --max-tokens 2000
   # Extract concrete examples
   probe extract <relevant-file>:<line>
   ```
   Or use `Grep`/`Glob` if Probe is not available.
4. Review any existing documentation or onboarding notes that cover this topic
5. Build understanding of the current state: what works, what's tricky, what's non-obvious

### Session Mode (Fallback — when no topic provided)

Ask yourself:

1. "What did I learn that wasn't obvious before starting?"
2. "Would future-me benefit from having this documented?"
3. "Was the solution non-obvious from docs alone?"
4. "Is this a multi-step workflow I'd repeat?"
5. "Did I query an external service the user will ask about again?"

**If NO to all → Skip, nothing to extract.** External service queries are almost always worth extracting.

---

## Phase 2: Check Existing

```bash
# Project skills (source + target)
ls .skillshare/skills/ 2>/dev/null
ls .claude/skills/ 2>/dev/null
rg -i "keyword" .skillshare/skills/ .claude/skills/ 2>/dev/null
# Global skills (source + Pilot defaults)
ls ~/.config/skillshare/skills/ 2>/dev/null
ls ~/.claude/pilot/skills/ 2>/dev/null
rg -i "keyword" ~/.config/skillshare/skills/ ~/.claude/pilot/skills/ 2>/dev/null
# Or use skillshare list for a merged view
skillshare list -p 2>/dev/null; skillshare list -g 2>/dev/null
```

| Found | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Nothing related | Create new |
| Same trigger/fix | Update existing (bump version) |
| Partial overlap | Update with new variant |

---

## Phase 3: Create Skill

**Detect environment first:**

```bash
HAS_SKILLSHARE=$(command -v skillshare >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo true || echo false)
HAS_PROJECT_MODE=$([ -d ".skillshare/skills" ] && echo true || echo false)
```

**Create the skill:**

```bash
if [ "$HAS_PROJECT_MODE" = true ]; then
  # Project scope — skill lives in repo, shared via git
  skillshare new {slug}-{name} -p
  # Or into a subfolder: skillshare new {slug}-{name} -p --into {category}
elif [ "$HAS_SKILLSHARE" = true ]; then
  # Global scope — skill applies across all projects
  skillshare new {slug}-{name} -g
else
  # No skillshare — create directly in Claude's skills directory
  mkdir -p .claude/skills/{slug}-{name}
  # Write SKILL.md directly
fi
```

Edit the generated (or manually created) `SKILL.md` with the skill content using the template from Phase 0.

**After creating (only if skillshare is available):** Sync to make the skill available to Claude.

```bash
if [ "$HAS_PROJECT_MODE" = true ]; then
  skillshare sync -p
elif [ "$HAS_SKILLSHARE" = true ]; then
  skillshare sync -g
fi
# No sync needed for fallback — .claude/skills/ is already the target
```

**Portability checklist** — skills are shared with users who may NOT have Pilot Shell:

- **Only use built-in Claude Code tools** in skill instructions: `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Bash`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Agent`, `WebFetch`, `WebSearch`, `Notebook`, `LSP`, `TodoRead`/`TodoWrite`
- **Never reference Pilot-specific tools:** `probe search/extract/query`, `playwright-cli`, `skillshare`, `pilot` CLI, Pilot MCP servers (`mem-search`, `context7`, `grep-mcp`, `web-fetch`, `web-search`)
- **Substitute with built-in equivalents:** `probe search` → `Grep`/`Glob`, `playwright-cli` → `Bash` with `npx playwright`, web fetch → `WebFetch`
- If a skill genuinely requires a non-standard tool, document it as a prerequisite in the skill body (not silently assume it exists)

**Determinism checklist** — maximize reliability:

- Prefer exact commands over descriptions (`run prettier --write .` not "format the code")
- Prefer scripts over multi-step instructions (reference `scripts/deploy.sh` not 5 prose steps)
- Use explicit values over judgment (`block files > 100KB` not "block large files")
- For high-risk operations (DB migrations, deploys): exact commands, validation steps, rollback plan
- For low-risk operations (code review, docs): general guidelines, let AI use judgment

**One skill = one purpose.** If the skill handles review AND testing AND deployment, split it.

## Phase 4: Quality Gates

### Structure Checklist

- [ ] Folder named in kebab-case
- [ ] `SKILL.md` file exists (exact spelling, case-sensitive)
- [ ] YAML frontmatter has `---` delimiters
- [ ] `name` field: kebab-case, no spaces, no capitals, matches folder name
- [ ] `description` includes WHAT and WHEN (under 1024 chars, no XML tags)
- [ ] No `README.md` inside the skill folder
- [ ] SKILL.md under 5,000 words

### Content Checklist

- [ ] Instructions are clear and actionable (commands > descriptions)
- [ ] Error handling included (Common Issues section)
- [ ] Examples provided (concrete input/output)
- [ ] "When NOT to Use" section with explicit exclusions
- [ ] Verification step (how to confirm it worked)
- [ ] No sensitive information (API keys, passwords → use env vars)
- [ ] No hardcoded paths (use relative paths or environment variables)
- [ ] References clearly linked (to `references/` or external docs)

### Triggering Test

Before finalizing, verify the description will activate correctly:

```
Should trigger:
- "[exact phrases a user would say]"
- "[paraphrased version of the request]"
- "[related but different phrasing]"

Should NOT trigger:
- "[unrelated topic that sounds similar]"
- "[general request the skill shouldn't handle]"
```

**Debug approach:** Ask Claude "When would you use the [skill name] skill?" — Claude will quote the description back. Adjust based on what's missing.

---

## Anti-Patterns & Troubleshooting

| Anti-Pattern | Fix |
|--------------|-----|
| **Kitchen sink** — skill does too many things | One skill = one purpose. Split it. |
| **Vague instructions** — "properly format the code" | Name the specific tool and command |
| **Explaining AI knowledge** — "React is a JavaScript library..." | Only add what AI doesn't know: YOUR conventions |
| **Too many options** — "use pdfplumber, PyMuPDF, or camelot..." | Give one default, mention alternatives only if needed |
| **No verification** — "deploy to staging" (how do you know it worked?) | Always include a verification command |
| **Hardcoded paths** — `/Users/john/projects/my-app/...` | Relative paths or environment variables |
| **Ambiguous language** — "Make sure to validate things properly" | `CRITICAL: Before calling create_project, verify: project name non-empty, at least one team member assigned` |

### Iteration Signals

| Signal | Symptom | Fix |
|--------|---------|-----|
| **Undertriggering** | Skill doesn't load when it should, users manually enabling it | Add more detail and trigger keywords to description |
| **Overtriggering** | Skill loads for irrelevant queries, users disabling it | Add negative triggers ("Do NOT use for..."), be more specific |
| **Instructions not followed** | Claude loads skill but ignores steps | Instructions too verbose (condense), buried (move critical to top), or ambiguous (use exact commands) |
| **Large context issues** | Skill seems slow or responses degraded | Move detailed docs to `references/`, keep SKILL.md under 5,000 words |

---

## Example

**Scenario:** User asks to create a skill for finding dead code using LSP.

**Result:** `.claude/skills/my-project-lsp-cleaner/SKILL.md`

```yaml
name: my-project-lsp-cleaner
description: |
  Find dead/unused code using LSP findReferences. Use when: (1) user asks
  to find dead code, (2) cleaning up codebase, (3) refactoring. Key insight:
  function with only 1 reference (definition) or only test refs is dead code.
targets: [claude]
tags: [refactoring, code-quality]

author: Claude Code
version: 1.0.0
```
